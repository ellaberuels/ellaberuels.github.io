          <h2>Spicy Buffalo Wings</h2>
              Buffalo wing, also called hot wing, chicken wing, or wing, deep-fried unbreaded chicken wings or drumsticks coated with a vinegar-and-cayenne-pepper hot sauce mixed with butter. They commonly are served with celery and a blue cheese dipping sauce, which acts as a cooling agent for the mouth. A popular bar food and appetizer, wings can be ordered mild or spicy, and boneless varieties are also common. The name comes from Buffalo, New York, where the dish was created. Several origin stories exist, but the basic recipe is the same. The key difference between buffalo wings and hot wings is often the spiciness factor: buffalo wings pack a zesty punch, but hot wings are the ones that will really set your mouth on fire. Although there are several versions of the origin of the buffalo wing, a common ground between each version involves the Bellissimo family and the year 1964. The family owned a small restaurant called Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York (hence the name: buffalo wing).Buffalo Wing taste has a distinct tangy and spicy taste that you can adjust depending on your preference: mild, medium, or hot. You can either enjoy it as an appetizer or pair it with a cup of steaming white rice.But are Buffalo wings good? well, before you down that next dozen, you might want to reconsider: Wings are really unhealthy even more than you might realize. First, the wings themselves are almost all skin and fat, which are certainly not good for you. Second, they're deep fried. He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well. Who could be following him this late at night and in this deadbeat part of town? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big time and was making off with the greenbacks. Was there another crook who'd had the same idea, and was now watching him and waiting for a chance to grab the fruit of his labour? Or did the steps behind him mean that one of many law officers in town was on to him and just waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his wrists? He nervously looked all around. Suddenly he saw the alley. Like lightning he darted off to the left and disappeared between the two warehouses almost falling over the bin lying in the middle of the pavement. He tried to nervously tap his way along in the inky darkness and suddenly stiffened: it was a dead-end, he would have to go back the way he had come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw the black outline of a figure coming around the corner. Is this the end of the line? he thought pressing himself back against the wall trying to make himself invisible in the dark, was all that planning and energy wasted? He was dripping with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the fear coming off his clothes. Suddenly next to him, with a barely noticeable squeak, a door swung quietly to and fro in the night's breeze. Could this be the haven he'd prayed for? Slowly he slid toward the door, pressing himself more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from his enemy. Would this door save his hide?He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well.
